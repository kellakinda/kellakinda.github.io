                    <p>So you are probably wondering what this “IoT” thing is that everyone keeps talking about. IoT stands for “Internet of things” and according to the most reliable source there is, Wikipedia, the “The internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data”.</p>

                    <p>If this was to abstract for you, imagine this. There once was a developer, let´s call him Bob, who ate toast for breakfast every morning. Bob really loved toast but he was not a morning person. For Bob every minute not asleep before 9am was a lost minute. So one day he decided to upgrade his toaster.</p>

                    <p>He installed a remote control that allowed him to start his toaster from the computer and set a toasting schedule like you would set your alarm. So now, when Bob got out of bed in the morning and went into the kitchen, the toast would already be done. This is the core of IoT, use current technology to enhance our everyday interaction with electronic devices. If gathering information about a device, or remotely controlling it can make our lives easier, it is a prime candidate for IoT.</p>

                <div class="col m7 offset-m1 push-m4">
                    <p>Back in 2008 more devices than people were connected to the internet and the number is growing rapidly every day.</p>

                    <p>Most of the IoT magic happens without us ever noticing it. Planes are communicating their positions to automatically avoid collision reducing the human interaction to a minimum. But there are also use cases that directly impact our lives. A good example for this are our running shoes that include GPS and motion sensors and allow us to track distance, speed, burnt calories and much more.</p>

                    <p>There are smart pill bottles that remind us to take our medicine, sensors that detect when our infants have done their “business” or asthma inhalers that detect your current health situation and dose accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Even our homes are getting smarter everyday. In modern buildings you can dim the lights, regulate heating, lock the door and close the curtains… with your phone. Even cities are getting smart. Traffic lights try to avoid congestion by regulating according to the current situation.</p>

                    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

                    <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

                    <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

                    <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

                    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

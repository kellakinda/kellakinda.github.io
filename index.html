                    <p>So you are probably wondering what this “IoT” thing is that everyone keeps talking about. IoT stands for “Internet of things” and according to the most reliable source there is, Wikipedia, the “The internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data”.</p>

                    <p>If this was to abstract for you, imagine this. There once was a developer, let´s call him Bob, who ate toast for breakfast every morning. Bob really loved toast but he was not a morning person. For Bob every minute not asleep before 9am was a lost minute. So one day he decided to upgrade his toaster.</p>

                    <p>He installed a remote control that allowed him to start his toaster from the computer and set a toasting schedule like you would set your alarm. So now, when Bob got out of bed in the morning and went into the kitchen, the toast would already be done. This is the core of IoT, use current technology to enhance our everyday interaction with electronic devices. If gathering information about a device, or remotely controlling it can make our lives easier, it is a prime candidate for IoT.</p>

                <div class="col m7 s12 offset-m1 push-m4">
                    <p>Back in 2008 more devices than people were connected to the internet and the number is growing rapidly every day.

                    <p>Most of the IoT magic happens without us ever noticing it. Planes are communicating their positions to automatically avoid collision reducing the human interaction to a minimum. But there are also use cases that directly impact our lives. A good example for this are our running shoes that include GPS and motion sensors and allow us to track distance, speed, burnt calories and much more.</p>

                    <p>There are smart pill bottles that remind us to take our medicine, sensors that detect when our infants have done their “business” or asthma inhalers that detect your current health situation and dose accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Even our homes are getting smarter everyday. In modern buildings you can dim the lights, regulate heating, lock the door and close the curtains… with your phone. City streets are automatically trying to avoid congestions by regulating their traffic lights according to the current traffic situation.</p>

                    <p>In the future even more devices will be communicating with each other providing us with lots of useful data. Experts estimate that in 2020 more than 50 billion devices will be online, gathering and sharing data while we are already talking about the “Internet of Everything” where everyone and everything will be communicating with each other.</p>

                    <p>While this new age will bring a lot of advantages it also packs some challenges. More devices means more data that needs to be saved and processed and more information about our personal life being available to a vast variety of people so data storage and data security will definitely be a big concern in the upcoming years.</p>

                <div class="col m7 s12">
                    <p>So now that you understand what IoT is and how it can enhance your life you are probably asking yourself: “How can I get into this. How can I profit from IoT today”?

                    <p>Well, if you are a consumer you probably already started without noticing it. Maybe you already got a fitness wristband or smart running shoes. If you want to go even further you could think about smart home solutions that allow you to turn off heating when you leave the house and turn it back on an hour before you get home or automatically turn off all the lights at once.</p>

                    <p>If you are a developer, getting started is a little bit more complicated. Basically you need some sort of single-board computer or SBC for short. This are computers the size of a smartphone with a processing and network unit that usually cost around 30 to 50 euros. Probably the most prominent one being the raspberry pi. There are numerous sites that sell raspberries, you can even buy them on amazon.</p>

                    <p>Once your raspberry arrived you have two options. You can either dive right into experimenting by hooking up the raspberry to a tv or pc monitor or you can search for one of many many great tutorials online written by very smart and creative people that created everything from smart microwaves to arcade consoles.</p>
